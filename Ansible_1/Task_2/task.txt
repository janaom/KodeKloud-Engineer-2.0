The Nautilus DevOps team has started
 testing their Ansible playbooks on different servers within the stack. 
They have placed some playbooks under `/home/thor/playbook/` directory on `jump host`
 which they want to test. Some of these playbooks have already been 
tested on different servers, but now they want to test them on `app server 3` in `Stratos DC`.
 However, they first need to create an inventory file so that Ansible 
can connect to the respective app. Below are some requirements:

a. Create an ini type Ansible inventory file `/home/thor/playbook/inventory` on `jump host`.

b. Add `App Server 3` in this inventory along with required variables that are needed to make it work.

c. The inventory hostname of the host should be the `server name` as per the wiki, for example `stapp01` for `app server 1` in `Stratos DC`.

`Note:` Validation will try to run the playbook using command `ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml` so please make sure the playbook works this way without passing any extra arguments.
