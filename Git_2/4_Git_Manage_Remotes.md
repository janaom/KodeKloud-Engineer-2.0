# Instructions

The xFusionCorp development team added updates to the project that is maintained under `/opt/demo.git` repo and cloned under `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/demo`. Recently some changes were made on Git server that is hosted on `Storage server` in `Stratos DC`. The DevOps team added some new Git remotes, so we need to update remote on `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/demo` repository as per details mentioned below:

a.  In `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/demo` repo add a new remote `dev_demo`  and point it to `/opt/xfusioncorp_demo.git` repository.

b. There is a file `/tmp/index.html` on same server; copy this file to the repo and add/commit to master branch.

c. Finally push `master` branch to this new remote origin.

# Solution

`ssh natasha@ststor01`

`sudo su -`

`cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/demo`

`git remote add dev_demo /opt/xfusioncorp_demo.git`

`cp /tmp/index.html .`

`git init`

`git add index.html`

`git commit -m "add index.html‚Äù`

`git push -u dev_demo  master`
