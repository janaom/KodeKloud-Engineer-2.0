# Instructions

The Nautilus application development team was working on a git repository `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/apps` present on `Storage server` in `Stratos DC`.
However, they reported an issue with the recent commits being pushed to this repo. They have asked the DevOps team to revert repo HEAD to last 
commit. Below are more details about the task:

1. In `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/apps`  git repository, revert the latest commit `( HEAD )` to the previous commit (JFYI the previous commit hash should be with `initial commit` message ).
2. Use `revert apps` message (please use all small letters for commit message) for the new revert commit.


# Solution

`ssh natasha@ststor01`

`sudo su -`

`cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/apps`

`git status`

`git log`

`git revert HEAD`

`git add .`

`git commit -m "revert apps‚Äù`

`git log`
